author: Alex Py

goal: |
  Develop a RESTful API for managing tasks using Flask.

overview:
  - "1. Setup & Environment"
  - "2. API Endpoints"
  - "3. Testing"
  - "4. Documentation"

steps:
  - number: 1
    name: "Setup & Environment"
    steps:
      - number: 1.1
        description: "Create virtualenv and install Flask"
      - number: 1.2
        description: "Initialize app.py and requirements.txt"
  - number: 2
    name: "API Endpoints"
    steps:
      - number: 2.1
        description: "Implement /tasks GET and POST"
      - number: 2.2
        description: "Implement /tasks/<id> PUT and DELETE"
  - number: 3
    name: "Testing"
    steps:
      - number: 3.1
        description: "Write unit tests with pytest"
  - number: 4
    name: "Documentation"
    steps:
      - number: 4.1
        description: "Write API usage in README.md"

outcome: |
  A RESTful API for tasks, with endpoints, tests, and documentation.

commitStandard:
  format: "type(scope step): subject"
  types: [feat, fix, docs, test, chore]
  rules:
    - Reference the step in every commit.
    - Use imperative mood.
  examples:
    - "feat(api 2.1): add GET/POST endpoints"
    - "test(api 3.1): add unit tests for endpoints"

procedures:
  - key: update
    number: 1
    name: "update"
    description: "Review README.md and awp.yml after each step. Update as needed to reflect the current state and next actions."
  - key: commit
    number: 2
    name: "commit"
    description: "Use the commitStandard for all commit messages. Reference the step in every commit."
  - key: next
    number: 3
    name: "next"
    description: "After update and commit, proceed to the next main step."
